Project Three Scope – Crypto Currency
Problem
Crypto has seen some of its best days and worst days. In very recent times there
has been some confusion in the space. We need a tool that can allow us to learn 
about certain coins and their characteristics to determine if we want to buy or 
sell those coins.

1. Determine your programming process scope with your team and validate 
with the IL.
2. Determine coin scope with your team and IL.
3. Determine output scope for the user with your team and IL.
4. Determine user scope with your team.


Initial Idea
To look at several different crypto coins currently circulating to see their weekly 
change. The idea is that we will plot the results on easily readable graphs to 
display the changes. This way as a potential investor you will have an image 
displaying the potential risk and rewards in a readable visualization, collectively 
and individually.

Process

pip install yfinance - You need to install Yfinance to run this code

Import the API yfinance 

Import pandas as pd

Using google will find the coins available on yahoo finance

First we want to know what coin to track

Secondly we want the weekly history

Finally we would like to see the price it ended on 

We will import matplotlib.pyplot to see a comparison of the coins we 
selected

Finally we will create images of graphs for each coin individually with a 
clear title for each and an overall title to explain what we are seeing.
